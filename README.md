# Practising with git

This is a repository which will be used to practice the git methodology. I'll be using IntelliJ and their VCS (Version control System)

##### TODO

1.Practise with basic commands such as...

```
git status      # Retrieve the current status (if a file has been modified, or nothing to commit...)
git log         # Retrieve the transactions we've done
git add <files> # Adding files to be committed
git commit      # Commit the added files
git push        # Push to the repository     
git branch      # See the actual branches
git branch <n>  # Branch with name n from the actual branch where the command is executed (creates a copy)
```
