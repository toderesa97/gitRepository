# Practising with git

## What is git?

Git is a helpful tool to keep track of our files in a project. Instead of copying files to test if a 
new feature is going to work, we can branch, and that means creating our 'developing' 
path, so we don't push to the master branch without being sure what we've done. It's supposed that the master branch
contains the last version (and obviously it must work) of our software.

This is a repository which will be used to practice the git methodology. I'll be using IntelliJ and their VCS (Version control System)

##### TODO

1.Practise with basic commands such as...

```
git status      # Retrieve the current status (if a file has been modified, or nothing to commit...)
git log         # Retrieve the transactions we've done
git add <files> # Adding files to be committed
git commit      # Commit the added files
git push        # Push to the repository     
git branch      # See the actual branches
git branch <n>  # Branch with name n from the actual branch where the command is executed (creates a copy)
```
